# Java Programming Assignments Solutions

## Overview

This repository contains solutions to various Java programming assignments, structured by weekly topics and major assignments. Each week covers different Java concepts, ranging from basic syntax to more advanced features. Major assignments represent significant tasks or exams that consolidate learning and assess understanding of the material covered.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into weekly folders. Each folder contains solutions related to that specific week's assignments and is structured as follows:

- **week_N**: Each week contains a number of different projects or exercises that relate to the topics covered that week.
  - Subfolders within each week represent distinct problems or projects.
  - Each subfolder contains Java source files that implement solutions to the given problems.
  
- **Assignment_N**: Each assignment folder represents a main control task (e.g., a major project or exam assignment).
  - These assignments often require more comprehensive solutions and may cover a wider range of topics learned throughout the course.
  - Each folder contains Java source files and potentially supporting documentation or test cases for the control task.

As the course progresses, new weeks and assignments will be added, each with new projects and topics.
